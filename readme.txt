Hey there.

Last week I spend my free time for learning Adobe Flex (http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/).
They made a good course for newbies - "Flex in a Week" by video (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/videotraining/). 

So this project is what I've all learnd there and even more.
This is company lease car chooser. Because I was need one for the company.

How it works?
Employees have different levels of budgets to order a car. For example, CEOs can allow more expensive cars that regular workers.
Now you actually have list of all cars that your company negotiated with lease companies.
Also there is taxes, here in Israel coupled with car prices.
(This first version is more likely for Israel, I didn't thought about worldwide because it's not a case right now).

For car previews I use Google Image Search API.
